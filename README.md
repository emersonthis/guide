We are using english as the master source of content. Domain expertise is key: public health, MD, virology, immunology, epidemiology, etc.

Your job here is to review updates and changes made by the community and confirm they are accurate and appropriate. Or to initiate your own changes.

If you also speak another language, we need your help reviewing translations, please check this: https://github.com/flattenthecurve/guide/wiki/Content-verification-(for-translations)

# I can read English and translate to another language
We need to keep the information updated in all languages with recent developments and recommendations.
